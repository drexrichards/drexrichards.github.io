    "text": "Urban ecosystems are a major component of the natural environment. Combined, they cover an area larger than Belarus, and are present on all continents except Antarctica. Urban ecosystems are the form of nature that most people interact with on a daily basis, and provide a range of benefits that enhance urban sustainability and livability. This research provides a systematic global atlas of urban ecosystems, across all urban areas with more than 250,000 residents in 2015.\nPlease explore the overview map below for more information on individual cities (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Interactive map containing information on percentage urban ecosystem cover for all urban areas with more than 250,000 residents in 2015. Please click each location for more information and a link to a detailed report\n\nMethods\nWe combined several datasets to map urban ecosystems across all urban areas globally that had more than 250,000 residents in 2015. The urban area extent and population estimate was extracted from the GHS Urban Centre Database 2015, R2019A (Florczyk et al 2019).\nUrban land and water cover types were mapped in 2020 at a spatial resolution of approximately 10 m by 10 m pixel size. These data were were extracted from the ESA WorldCover dataset 2020 (Zanaga et al. 2021).\nTree height was mapped in 2020 at a spatial resolution of approximately 10 m by 10 m pixel size. We extracted vegetation heights only for regions mapped as tree cover, to ensure internal consistency. These data were extracted from the global canopy height database (Lang et al. 2022).\nHabitat connectivity and patch size are important attributes of urban ecosystems. Urban ecosystems that are connected to the adjacent rural areas may benefit from connectivity to these larger natural and semi-natural areas. We mapped the areas of all terrestrial and vegetated freshwater urban ecosystem types (thus excluding water and built-up land cover types) that were connected to the rural-urban boundary. Larger patches of contiguous urban ecosystem may provide greater benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and recreation. We quantified the patch size of all contiguous patches of urban ecosystems that were not adjacent to the rural-urban boundary.\n\n\nData\nSpatial datasets describing the urban ecosystems of each urban area are available in the Figshare Collection. Each urban area is available as an individual geoTiff dataset, named by the urban area name and a unique identification number.\nEach raster dataset consists of 5 layers. In order, these layers are; the land cover type, tree canopy height, patch size, connectedness to the rural-urban boundary, and a classification of urban ecosystem types based on connectedness and patch size (Figure 2).\n Figure 2. Example map layers for Bandung, Indonesia.\nInformation on each of the layers contained in the dataset is listed below;\n\nLand cover types\nLand cover types follow the ESA WorldCover indexing system;\n\n\n\nRaster value\nLand cover\n\n\n\n\n10\nTree cover\n\n\n20\nShrubland\n\n\n30\nGrassland\n\n\n40\nCropland\n\n\n50\nBuilt-up\n\n\n60\nBare/ sparse vegetation\n\n\n70\nSnow and ice\n\n\n80\nPermanent water bodies\n\n\n90\nHerbaceous wetland\n\n\n95\nMangrove\n\n\n100\nMoss and lichen\n\n\n\n\n\nTree canopy height\nTree canopy height is described in metres above the ground surface.\n\n\nPatch size\nPatch size is described in hectares. Only patches of urban ecosystem not connected to the rural-urban boundary are included.\n\n\nConnectedness\nConnectedness to the rural-urban boundary is described as a binary variable. Cells with 1 values are urban ecosystems connected to the boundary, while cells with 0 values are urban ecosystems disconnected contiguously from the boundary.\n\n\nType\nUrban ecosystem spatial type is defined as below;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaster value\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n1\nDisconnected from rural-urban boundary and smaller than 1 ha in patch size.\n\n\n2\nDisconnected from rural-urban boundary and between 1 ha and 10 ha in patch size.\n\n\n3\nDisconnected from rural-urban boundary and greater than 10 ha in patch size.\n\n\n4\nConnected to the rural-urban boundary (urban fringe).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nFlorczyk A., Corbane C,.

    "text": "Hi, I’m an ecologist interested in understanding the varied contributions that nature makes to people. My research has looked at urban ecosystems, mangrove forests, and temperate wetlands across local, national, and global scales. I use field measurements, remote sensing, and new types of data to quantify the relationships between ecosystems and people.\nI’m currently based at Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research in Aotearoa New Zealand. My work looks at future scenarios of climate change adaptation, with projects on Te Manahuna Mackenzie Country, establishment of trees in rural landscapes, and urban ecosystem services. I was previously a Principal Investigator at the Singapore-ETH Centre, and remain involved in the ETH Zürich Future Cities Laboratory."

    "text": "My research uses interdisciplinary approaches to analyse the relationships between nature and people.\n\nClimate adaptation\nTo adapt to climate change, people must design landscapes that store carbon, mitigate climate risks, enhance biodiversity, and support economic and societal well-being. To achieve ambitious adaptation, landscapes must integrate nature-based solutions. My work develops geospatial models to predict the impacts of nature-based solutions in the future, and applies these models to test alternative scenarios at local - global scales. Ongoing work in this area includes the collaborative 5 year research programme Trees in landscapes | Te Kapunipunitanga a Tāne Mahuta.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds potential to transform the way that scientific information and advice is provided to decision-makers. However, this untested technology also holds substantial risks, including risks of misuse and misinformation, erroneous guidance, and ethical concerns. My research into GenAI as applied to environmental decision-making combines technology development with ethical and social research methods, to develop guidelines for responsible applications that support environmental outcomes alongside human interests and well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban ecosystems\nUrban ecosystems include parks, gardens, and remnant patches of natural vegetation. These ecosystems provide many critical benefits to society, including cooling the environment, cleaning the air, and providing spaces for recreation and relaxation. My research has looked at a broad range of these ecosystem services, using a mix of ecology, social sciences, and data analysis.\nI’m interested in looking at urban ecosystems at a range of spatial scales. To inform urban planning and design, it is often useful to have high-resolution information on specific cities. For example, please take a look at some of my work in Singapore and Ōtautahi - Christchurch. It can also be useful to zoom out, and understand how cities around the world vary in their ecosystem types, covers, and configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMangroves\nMangrove forests are a unique coastal ecosystem found mainly in the tropics. Mangroves have dense carbon stocks and can protect coastlines against natural hazards. However, they have been heavily deforested, often due to demands for fish, palm oil, and other products.\nMy work has analysed mangrove forest ecosystem services and pressures at individual sites, the hotspot region of Southeast Asia, and globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal quantification of mangrove carbon stocks over 20 years. From Richards et al. 2020\n\n\nData science\nQuantifying the benefits of nature requires innovative approaches. My work has developed new ways of extracting useful information from large online datasets, for example using social media data to understand how people use and appreciate parks and other outdoor spaces, or analysing the text of historical books to understand trends in interest in different environmental issues. I have also written methods for quantifying structural parameters of vegetation using images from online panoramic photograph datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing of panoramic fisheye photographs to model shade provision.

    "text": "I lived in Singapore for 6 years, working at NUS and the Singapore-ETH Centre. During this time I had several projects about urban ecosystems and ecosystem services in the city. The Singapore-ETH Centre aims to cross disciplinary boundaries and produce transformative research that can be translated to inform urban planning and design. In addition to academic outputs, we also produced several resources for practice, including the design guideline; Ecosystem services in urban landscapes - Benefits of tropical urban vegetation.\nI was also a Principal Investigator for Natural Capital Singapore - the first national assessment of ecosystems and ecosystem services. We quantified more than 10 types of benefits that people gain from nature in the city, and produced an interactive map to visualise these findings. The research findings are also available as a software package for R, that allows users to evaluate the performance of existing urban landscapes and new designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap layers describing ecosystem service provision in Singapore, created as part of Natural Capital Singapore.
