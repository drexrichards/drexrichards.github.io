Hi, I'm an ecologist interested in understanding the varied contributions that nature makes to people. My research has looked at urban ecosystems, mangrove forests, and temperate wetlands across local, national, and global scales. I use field measurements, remote sensing, and new types of data to quantify the relationships between ecosystems and people.

I'm currently based at [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/about-us/our-people/dan-richards) in Aotearoa New Zealand.
