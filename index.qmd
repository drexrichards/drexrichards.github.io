Hi, I'm an ecologist interested in understanding the varied contributions that nature makes to people. My research has looked at urban ecosystems, mangrove forests, and temperate wetlands across local, national, and global scales. I use field measurements, remote sensing, and new types of data to quantify the relationships between ecosystems and people.

I'm currently based at [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/about-us/our-people/dan-richards) in Aotearoa New Zealand. My work looks at future scenarios of climate change adaptation, with projects on Te Manahuna Mackenzie Country, establishment of trees in rural landscapes, and [urban ecosystem services](http://mwlr.nz/ncp-christchurch). I was previously a Principal Investigator at the Singapore-ETH Centre, and remain involved in the ETH ZÃ¼rich [Future Cities Laboratory](https://fcl.ethz.ch/research/infrastructures-and-ecologies/comparative-ecology-of-cities.html).
